* PuLang - To My Life Teacher
** Build
*** Windows
    We use Cmake and Ninja. Make sure you are at the project root. Then:
    #+begin_src bash
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ../src -GNinja
      cmake --build .
    #+end_src
    After that, you should also copy the *antlr4-runtime.dll* from *lib/*.
